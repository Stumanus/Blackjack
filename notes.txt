- Scoring mechanism needs to be reworked to score each individual hand
    - Score each hand after it is played?
    - Iterate through hand list and return the sum of individual hand scores?
    *** Current Functionality: Each hand object is initialized with a bet amount that can be changed depending on how the hand is played. 
    *** Bet incrementing logic is built into the different types of moves (hit,stand,split,double)
    *** THIS FUNCIONALITY HAS NOT BEEN TESTED YET

- Add indication of what hand is being played (within hand_list) into game board display functions
    - Should Hand() have a self.in_play = True/False boolean? This could be used to alter the way it's displayed in print_player_hand()

-Testing Notes 12/15/23:
    -Scoring mechanism not working, probably need to remove scoring logic from outside the new scoring loop. 
    -I was able to keep betting after having 0 chips. Placed bed with -20 chips. 
    -Dealer is sometimes being assigned the push state in final scoring loop, when they should be assigned win state (to their hand)
