- Scoring mechanism needs to be reworked to score each individual hand
    - Score each hand after it is played?
    - Iterate through hand list and return the sum of individual hand scores?
    *** Current Functionality: Each hand object is initialized with a bet amount that can be changed depending on how the hand is played. 
    *** Bet incrementing logic is built into the different types of moves (hit,stand,split,double)
    *** THIS FUNCIONALITY HAS NOT BEEN TESTED YET

- Add indication of what hand is being played (within hand_list) into game board display functions
    - Should Hand() have a self.in_play = True/False boolean? This could be used to alter the way it's displayed in print_player_hand()

- Right now cards are discarded after a round with list.clear(), write a function (nested for loops) to extract each card from 
    player hand_list and add to discard_pile?
